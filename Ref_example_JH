            <p>Glooglob doesnt make a mess and doesnt leave any remains on any material. If Glooglob
                dries out, pour water on it to remove from surface. </p>
            <p>Glooglob is non-toxic to the touch of skin so it can easily be removed if there is an
                accident.This problem occurs when HTML files unrelated to the current transformation
                are found in the output directory. Delete the content of the output directory and
                run the transformation again.</p>

            <title>Why should I use Glooglob</title>
            <p>Glooglob dries clear so it is perfect for shattered  objects. form the object however
                you like and use the Glooglob as the adhesive and after 24 hours of drying the
                shattered object will look like new.  </p>
            <p>Once Glooglob dries, it becomes extremely study and can be used as suport for a table
                or shelf. </p>
            <p>DO NOT USE WATER AROUND GLOOGLOB. IF WATER TOUCHES GLOOGLOB IT WILL CHANGE INTO ITS
                LIQUID STATE.</p>
